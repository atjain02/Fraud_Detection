Details for description of the data are provided in Data Dictionary.txt

More details about the procedure and the data cleansing, normalizing, and training choices are in Fraud_Detection.ipynb as comments. 
Conclusion: A Decision Tree classification model is able to perform at an accuracy of over 99% to detect fraudulent entires. 

NOTE:
Unfortunately, the dataset containing all the entires could not be uploaded to GitHub because the file was too large.
